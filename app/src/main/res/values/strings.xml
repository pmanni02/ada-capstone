The rating system used is from standards sets by the Department of Health & Social Care in the United Kingdom. Red, orange, and green indicate high, medium, and low amounts of the nutrient respectively. Percent daily (%DV) values, with the exception of the energy quantity, are based on a 2,000 calorie diet. The energy %DV will be calculated per user if additional information is provided. This app uses the Revised Harris-Benedict equation to calculate Basal Metabolic Rate.]]></string>

    <string name="fat_desc">Fat is both a source for fatty acids as well as how our bodies absorb vitamins A, D, and E. Two main two types of fat are saturated and unsaturated. Saturated fats are often come from animals (meat, dairy, and some plants). Too much saturated fat leads to increased cholesterol which can put you at higher risk for heart disease and stroke. Unsaturated fat is typically liquid at room temperature. Plant oils, nuts, avocados, and some fish are examples of foods high in unsaturated fat. Unsaturated fat can help lower bad types of cholesterol.</string>
