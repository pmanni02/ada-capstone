The rating system used is from standards sets by the Department of Health & Social Care in the United Kingdom. Red, orange, and green indicate high, medium, and low amounts of the nutrient respectively. Percent daily (%DV) values, with the exception of the energy quantity, are based on a 2,000 calorie diet. The energy %DV will be calculated per user if additional information is provided. This app uses the Revised Harris-Benedict equation to calculate Basal Metabolic Rate.]]></string>
